Hello, this is a small project to translate Python from Vietnamese to English. What you need to do is download this project, and then you can write the translated code into the file python-phuc.pyp with functions like viet(), lon_nhat(), nho_nhat(). To make it easier for you to write your code, we have already written a few functions like he_dieu_hanh(), ngay_le_vn(), tim_file(file_name, search_path='/'), etc. Yeah, and the code translated into Vietnamese in the .pyp file will be converted into standard Python format by the python.py file. Therefore, the python.py file is considered a system file for .pyp, so please don't modify it. I wish you a great day. Thank you.
